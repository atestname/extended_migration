% use:
%   op = opLInterp1D(x1,x2)
%
% input:
%   x1 - input grid (i.e., [0:10:1000])
%   x2 - output grid (i.e., [0:1:1000])
%
% output:
%   op - SPOT operator: cubic Lagrange interpolation for input vectors of
%   same length as x1. Output has same lenght as x2.
%
% grids may also be non-equidistant and do not have to coincide
% completely. Output outside of the domain is set to zero.
